<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<font style="Georgia"><p>Marcus Rashford MBE (born 31 October 1997) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Manchester United and the England national team.
A Manchester United player from the age of seven, Rashford scored two goals on both his first-team debut against Midtjylland in the UEFA Europa League in February 2016 and his Premier League debut against Arsenal three days later. He also scored in his first Manchester derby, as well as on his EFL Cup and UEFA Champions League debuts. With United, Rashford has so far won the FA Cup, EFL Cup, FA Community Shield and Europa League.</p></font>

<h3>Early Football Career:</h3>
<p>Rashford began playing football for Fletcher Moss Rangers at the age of five,starting out as a goalkeeper, and cited former United goalkeeper Tim Howard as his goalkeeping idol.Fletcher Ross Rangers academy development officer Dave Horrocks recalls that Rashford was on a "different level" to other boys, playing a major role as the team won a tournament with 15 scouts from various clubs watching.
He spent a week training with Manchester City before he joined the academy system at Manchester United at the age of seven, amid interest from Everton and Liverpool.He credited his brothers with helping him decide to join United.Former United youth coach Paul McGuinness quickly saw Rashford's potential due to his athleticism both on and off the ball,but during his early years at the club, he often had to miss training as he found it difficult to get to training due to his mother and brothers working, and eventually received assistance from youth coaches Dave Bushell, Eamon Mulvey, and Tony Whelan, who helped find drivers for Rashford to get to the training ground. When he was 11, he became the youngest ever player to be selected for the Manchester United Schoolboy Scholars scheme, usually reserved for players 12 and above.He was fastracked and began playing cage football with Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Ravel Morrison, helping to increase his skill level playing with players four years his senior.
In 2012, he was part of the Manchester United under-15 squad which finished second in the 23rd annual Marveld tournament.In 2014, The Guardian named him as Manchester United's best prospect in the 2014 Next Generation, saying that his "total-football style gives him a fair chance of going all the way".Rashford trained with United's first team for the first time aged 16 under the management of David Moyes during the 2013–14 season, and described the training session as "priceless" to himself and other United academy players; he began training with the first team more regularly, and was deemed a "high flier" by coaches.</p>

<h3>His Football Debut: </h3>
<p>On 25 February 2016, Rashford was included in the 18-man squad for United's UEFA Europa League round of 32, second leg tie against Danish club Midtjylland, owing to an injury crisis which saw 13 players injured.After Anthony Martial was injured in the warm-up, Rashford was chosen to start the game, and marked his first-team debut with two goals in the second half of a 5–1 win.Rashford's goals made him Manchester United's youngest ever scorer in European competition, beating a record previously held by George Best,and which was later broken by Mason Greenwood in the 2019–20 season.Rashford made his Premier League debut against Arsenal three days later; he again scored twice and provided the assist for the other goal in a 3–2 home victory against their rivals, making him the third youngest scorer for United in Premier League history after Federico Macheda and Danny Welbeck.Van Gaal hailed his performance as "fantastic" and better than his first match,but urged caution from the press not to harass and hype him, feeling he had the character to cope.</p>

<h3>Poverty Campaign</h3>
<p>In October 2019, Rashford set up the In the Box campaign with Selfridges to give homeless people essential items over the Christmas period,something he had wanted to do when first training with United as a youth.He and his mother visited homeless shelters to personally hand the boxes out, while also sending some to a children's home in his grandmother's home country of Saint Kitts and Nevis.He was reportedly frustrated by the limited outreach the campaign resulted in.
In March 2020, during the UK lockdown imposed by Boris Johnson's government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rashford teamed up with the poverty and food waste charity FareShare to deliver meals to those in the Greater Manchester area who were no longer receiving their free school meals,as well as to children who attended community centres and school breakfast clubs.Rashford initially contacted FareShare to make a "substantial" donation, but after discussion with CEO Lindsay Boswell, he decided to provide his full support.With an initial target of supporting 400,000 children in the region, the initiative quickly raised over £20 million to provide food for children nationwide who, if still at school, would be receiving free school meals.On 11 June, Rashford revealed that the charity had been able to reach three million children across the country,a figure which rose to four million the following month.[251]</p>
